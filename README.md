# Wind Power Plant Location Selection System

# Business Understanding 

The proposed project aims to develop a recommendation system to identify the best locations for setting up a wind power plant based on weather conditions. Wind energy is a promising renewable resource, but its efficiency and profitability depend on the wind patterns at specific locations. By leveraging historical weather data and geographical information, this recommendation system will help energy companies and policymakers make informed decisions about the optimal placement of wind power plants, maximizing energy generation and contributing to sustainable development.

## Problem Statement 
Selecting the most suitable locations for wind power plants is critical for maximizing energy generation and ensuring a sustainable and profitable operation. However, the efficiency of wind energy production relies heavily on the prevailing weather conditions in specific areas. The lack of a comprehensive and data-driven approach to assess the wind energy potential at different locations hinders effective decision-making for energy companies and policymakers.

This project aims to address this challenge by developing a recommendation system that utilizes historical weather data and geographical information to rank potential wind power plant locations. The system will consider factors such as wind speed, direction, temperature, humidity, and other relevant weather parameters to identify the regions with the highest wind energy potential. By providing accurate and data-driven location recommendations, this project seeks to empower stakeholders in the renewable energy sector to make informed choices, optimize wind power generation, and contribute to sustainable energy development.

The motivation behind this project stems from the urgent need to transition to renewable energy sources and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels. By facilitating the efficient deployment of wind power plants in areas with optimal wind conditions, the recommendation system can have a positive impact on the global energy crisis and foster a greener and more sustainable future.

## Project Objectives 
* Develop a predictive model: Create a robust predictive model capable of estimating the energy output of a wind farm  based on historical wind data and surrounding wind conditions on an Hourly basis.
* Build a system for wind power plant locations: Build an application to recommend the best locations for setting up a wind power plant based on weather conditions.
* Build a system: Build an application to recommend the Power Grid to suggest the best time to utilize the energy from wind farms.
* Optimize wind energy generation: Enable decision-makers to optimize wind energy generation by providing accurate predictions, facilitating efficient resource planning and utilization of wind power.
